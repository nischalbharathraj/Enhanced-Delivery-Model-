# Enhanced-Delivery-Model-
**Data Loading & Exploration**

Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure, identify missing values, and inspect data types.
**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

Corrected data types, handled missing values using statistical imputation, and dropped irrelevant columns.
Feature Engineering

Extracted temporal features (e.g., day, month, weekend), calculated distances using geodesic methods, and encoded categorical variables.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Visualized feature distributions and their impact on delivery times using boxplots, count plots, and heatmaps.
**Model Selection & Training**

Tested models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and evaluated models with R², RMSE, and MAE metrics.
Performance Evaluation

**XGBoost achieved the best performance with R² ~ 92% and low RMSE, indicating strong predictive accuracy.
Insights & Recommendations******

Key drivers of delivery time: distance, order preparation time, and traffic density.
Suggested optimizing routes and mitigating delays during adverse traffic and weather conditions.
